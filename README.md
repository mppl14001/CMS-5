The CMS behind CodePilot.

It was built in a weekend.

Installing CodePilot CMS
--------------------------------------
This project is currently in heavy development and things might be horribly broken.
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), [MongoDB](http://http://www.mongodb.org/), [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/), and [Redis](http://redis.io/) installed and running.

1. Copy `app/config.example.json` to `app/config.json`. In `app/config.json`, fill in your MongoDB details, Twitter OAuth information, and S3 details.
2. Run `npm install`
This'll take a while as it fetches CodePilot's dependencies.
3. Run `npm start`. Assuming everything is okay, you'll be able to access CodePilot at `http://localhost:3000/`.

When you make a change, you will have to stop the server by pressing `^C`, and then start it up again.

Common Errors and how to fix them
---------------------------------

`TypeError: Uncaught, unspecified "error" event.`

This is most likely caused because your MongoDB server is not running. Start the server and try again.

`Error: OAuthStrategy requires session support. Did you forget app.use(express.session(...))?`

This is caused by your Redis server not running. Start your Redis server using the `redis-server` command and try again. Make sure to restart the app after you've done this.

Configuration
-------------

There are two ways to specify configuration options for the CodePilot CMS.

1. `config.json`: Copy `app/config.example.json` to `app/config.json` and edit the settings appropriately. These will be the default settings if not specified elsewhere.
2. Command Line Arguments: When starting the application, specify the configuration option as a command line argument like so: `--<key> <value>`. If the key is specified in
the command line and `config.json`, then the command line argument value will be used.

Unit Tests
----------

  To test the app, run `make test`, or `mocha`.
